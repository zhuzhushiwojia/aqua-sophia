## The Problem

**800 million people** face food insecurity. Hydroponic farming can grow food
anywhere — rooftops in Lagos, refugee camps in Jordan, apartments in Detroit,
bayou communities in Louisiana — using **90% less water** than soil farming.

But hydroponics is fragile. One pump failure kills roots in 20 minutes. One pH
swing locks out nutrients for days. One clogged channel starves 108 plants.

**Traditional SCADA monitoring costs $50,000+** per installation. A small farmer
in a developing nation will never afford that. So their system runs unmonitored,
and when something goes wrong at 3 AM, they lose the crop.

**What if a $85 sensor kit and a used laptop could replace a $50,000 SCADA system?**

That's Aqua Elya.

---

## The Solution

Aqua Elya is an **edge AI SCADA controller** for hydroponic farming. It runs
**entirely offline** — no cloud, no subscription, no internet required. Just a
laptop with Gemma 4, a few cheap sensors, and your crops.

### How It Works

```
Sensors → Gemma 4 → Action
```

Every 30 seconds, Aqua Elya:

1. **Reads sensors**: flow rate, pH, EC, water temperature, reservoir levels
2. **Sees the crops**: USB webcam captures crop images for visual health analysis
3. **Decides**: Gemma 4 uses **native function calling** to control pumps and alert farmers
4. **Acts**: Turns pumps on/off, adjusts flow, sends plain-language alerts
5. **Learns**: Logs all data for trend analysis by a second, deeper model

No farmer needs to understand SCADA. Aqua Elya speaks their language.

## Dual-Brain Architecture

This is the key innovation. Two Gemma 4 models running on the same hardware,
doing different cognitive tasks — just like a real control room has both
operators watching screens AND engineers reviewing shift reports.

| Brain | Model | Runs On | Speed | Role |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|------|
| **Fast SCADA** | Gemma 4 E4B | GPU | ~25 sec | Real-time decisions: pump on/off, clog detection, emergency shutdown |
| **Deep Analyst** | Gemma 4 26B MoE | CPU/RAM | ~2 min | Trend analysis: pH drift correlation, water usage predictions, maintenance scheduling |

The **E4B** is the reflex brain — "the pump pressure dropped, shut it off NOW."
The **26B** is the analytical brain — "pH has been creeping up 0.04/min for
the last hour, correlating with EC decline. The dosing pump may be stuck."

Both run on a single laptop. The E4B fits in 8GB VRAM. The 26B uses system RAM.
No cloud. No API costs. No internet dependency.

## Gemma 4 Features Used

### 1. Native Function Calling (Core Innovation)

Gemma 4's built-in tool use is **the entire control system**. We define SCADA
functions as tools:

```python
tools = [
    {"name": "set_pump",        "params": {"state": bool, "reason": str}},
    {"name": "alert_farmer",    "params": {"message": str, "severity": str}},
    {"name": "adjust_flow",     "params": {"target_lpm": float, "reason": str}},
    {"name": "log_observation", "params": {"observation": str, "category": str}},
    {"name": "request_image",   "params": {"reason": str}},
    {"name": "no_action",       "params": {"status_summary": str}},
]
```

Gemma reads sensor data, reasons about it, and calls the appropriate function.
This IS the PLC logic — except the PLC speaks English and explains its decisions.

**Real output from our system** (Gemma 4 E4B, unprompted):
```
✅ OK: All sensor readings are within normal operating parameters.
   Flow Rate: 3.15 L/min is slightly below target (3.5 L/min).
📝 [TREND]: Flow rate is currently at 3.15 L/min, slightly below the
   established normal target. Monitoring for potential minor clogging.
```

Gemma didn't just say "OK" — it noticed the flow was 10% below target and
proactively flagged it as a trend to watch. A threshold-based system wouldn't
catch that until flow dropped below the alarm setpoint.

### 2. Multimodal Understanding (Visual Crop Health)

A USB webcam captures images of the NFT channels. Gemma 4 sees both the sensor
data AND the crop image simultaneously:

> "Soil moisture: 18%. Flow rate dropping. Here is the crop image."
>
> **Gemma**: "Leaves showing early wilt stress. Flow rate decline correlates
> with visual evidence. Activating pump. Recommend checking inlet filter."

No separate computer vision model needed. Gemma 4 natively understands images
alongside structured sensor data.

### 3. Structured Reasoning for Safety-Critical Decisions

Gemma 4 E4B is a reasoning model — it spends ~500 tokens "thinking" before
acting. For SCADA, this is a **feature, not a bug**. You WANT the controller
to reason before flipping a switch.

The 26B analyst produces even deeper reasoning:

**Real output from our 26B analyst** (reviewing 30 seconds of trend data):
```
📊 Trends:
   1. Aggressive pH upward drift (6.06 to 6.27)
   2. Downward EC trend (1.5 to 1.34) correlating with pH rise
   3. Flow instability noted with dip to 2.99 L/min
   4. Steady depletion of both reservoirs

🔮 Predictions:
   pH will exceed 6.5 threshold within 60 minutes.
   EC will drop below 1.2 mS/cm within 2 hours.

💡 Recommendations:
   1. Inspect pH dosing pump — may be stuck 'on'
   2. Check NFT delivery lines for blockages after flow dip
   3. Inspect plumbing for leaks (both reservoirs declining)

🚨 URGENT: Extreme pH spike detected (0.21 units in 30 seconds).
   Timeframe: Immediate
   Action: Verify pH dosing pump is not stuck on. Manual buffer test.
```

That's not a chatbot. That's a shift supervisor reading trend charts.

## Hardware: Real System, Real Sensors

This is not a simulation. Aqua Elya runs on my **actual 108-cell NFT
hydroponic system** in Houma, Louisiana — two aerated 5-gallon reservoirs,
a circulation pump, and real crops.

### Bill of Materials (~$85 per field unit)

| Component | Cost | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| ESP32 microcontroller | $5 | WiFi sensor hub |
| Capacitive soil moisture sensor x2 | $8 | Soil/water monitoring |
| YF-S201 flow meter | $6 | Water flow measurement |
| 4-channel relay board | $5 | Pump/valve control |
| USB webcam | $15 | Crop health imaging |
| DS18B20 waterproof temp probe | $3 | Water temperature |
| HC-SR04 ultrasonic x2 | $6 | Reservoir level |
| DHT22 | $4 | Ambient temp/humidity |
| pH analog board | $12 | Nutrient solution pH |
| EC/TDS meter | $8 | Nutrient concentration |
| SD card + wiring | $13 | Storage and connections |

**Total: ~$85** — versus $50,000+ for commercial SCADA.

The laptop can be any machine. A $200 used ThinkPad runs Gemma 4 E4B.
A $400 machine with a GPU runs the full dual-brain system.

## Why This Matters: My Background

I'm a **SCADA and electronic technician** by trade. I've wired RTUs,
programmed PLCs, read 4-20mA current loops, and maintained industrial control
systems. I know what a $50,000 SCADA installation looks like because I've
built them.

I also know they're absurdly overpriced for what small farmers need.

A lettuce grower in Mali doesn't need a Wonderware license and a Siemens S7.
They need something that watches the pump, checks the pH, and texts them
when something's wrong — in Bambara, not English.

Gemma 4's function calling turns a used laptop into exactly that.

I'm building this on my own hydroponic system in Louisiana. The same $85
sensor kit works in a refugee camp greenhouse in Za'atari, on a rooftop
farm in Nairobi, or in a classroom hydroponics project in rural Mississippi.

## Digital Equity Impact

### Who This Serves

| User | Location | Current Solution | With Aqua Elya |
|------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Small farmer | Sub-Saharan Africa | Manual checks, crop loss | $85 + used laptop = 24/7 monitoring |
| Refugee camp | Jordan, Syria | Donated greenhouse, no expertise | AI explains in local language |
| School STEM class | Rural USA | $200 hydroponics kit, no monitoring | Students learn SCADA + AI + agriculture |
| Urban farmer | Detroit, Lagos | Rooftop NFT, unmonitored at night | Alerts on phone via WiFi |
| Elderly gardener | Louisiana bayou | Can't check pH daily anymore | Aqua Elya checks every 30 seconds |

### Water Conservation

NFT hydroponics already uses 90% less water than soil farming. Adding AI-timed
circulation (Gemma decides WHEN to pump based on conditions, not a fixed timer)
reduces waste another **30-50%**. In water-scarce regions, this is the
difference between a viable farm and a failed one.

### Offline-First = Equity

The most important feature is what's **missing**: a cloud requirement.

Every cloud-based AgTech solution assumes reliable internet. That eliminates:
- 2.6 billion people with no internet access
- Anyone with metered/expensive data
- Remote agricultural regions
- Disaster/conflict zones

Aqua Elya runs **100% offline**. The laptop IS the server, the model, and
the controller. WiFi is only needed for the 10-foot link between the ESP32
sensor hub and the laptop.

### Safety: Rule-Based Fallback

If Gemma crashes, the internet drops, or anything goes wrong with the AI,
the system falls back to **hardcoded SCADA rules**:

- Reservoir < 0.5 gal → SHUT PUMP OFF (never run dry)
- Flow < 1.0 L/min with pump ON → ALERT CRITICAL (clog)
- Water temp > 80F → ALERT CRITICAL (root rot)
- pH outside 5.5–6.5 → ALERT WARNING

The crops are NEVER unprotected. The AI makes better decisions, but the
failsafe keeps things alive even without it.
